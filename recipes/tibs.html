    <h3>Spiced Sautéed Meat (A Celebration Dish)</h3>
    <p>
      Tibs (or T'ibs) is one of the most popular and quickly prepared dishes in
      Ethiopian cuisine, often served during celebrations or as a mark of
      respect for a guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "tibs" literally means "fried" or "sautéed." It features
      bite-sized pieces of meat—most commonly beef or lamb—that are quickly
      pan-fried with Ethiopian spiced butter, aromatics, and the signature
      Berbere spice blend.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cubed beef</li>
      <li>Red Onions(lots)</li>
      <li>Niter <em>kibbeh</em></li>
      <li>Oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep: Cut the meat into bite-sized cubes and season lightly with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a hot pan or skillet, quickly sear the meat (often in batches) until
        browned, then set it aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the Niter Kibbeh (or heat the oil) and quickly sauté the sliced
        onions, garlic, and ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the meat to the pan. Stir in the Berbere spice (or Awaze paste),
        along with any other seasonings or a splash of water/broth to create a
        light glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish & Serve: Sauté until the meat is cooked to the desired doneness.
        Serve immediately while still sizzling, often garnished with fresh
        jalapeño, alongside Injera (the spongy flatbread).
