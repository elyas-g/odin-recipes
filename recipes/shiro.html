    <h3>Velvety, Savory Chickpea Flour Stew (Vegan-Friendly Staple)</h3>
    <p>
      Shiro Wet is a comforting, easy-to-make Ethiopian stew that is a staple,
      especially during fasting seasons when meat and dairy are avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its unique, thick, and velvety texture comes from its main ingredient:
      Shiro Powder (finely ground chickpeas or broad beans, often pre-mixed with
      spices). The powder is slowly simmered with aromatics like onion, garlic,
      and ginger, resulting in a rich, flavorful, and protein-packed stew.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shiro powder</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Tomato</li>
      <li>Niter <em>kibbeh</em></li>
      <li>Berbere</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sauté finely chopped onions in oil (or Niter Kibbeh) until softened and
        slightly golden. Add garlic, ginger, and tomato/tomato paste, cooking
        until the mixture reduces.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, whisk the Shiro Powder with water until a lump-free,
        thick slurry is formed.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the Shiro slurry into the pot with the sautéed aromatics.</li>
      <li>
        Stir continuously over medium heat until the stew comes to a boil.
        Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 5–15 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, until it reaches a desired, thick consistency and the
        "raw" flour taste has cooked out
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot, traditionally with Injera.</li>
