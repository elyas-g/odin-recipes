    <h3>Ethiopia's National Dish: Rich, Spicy, and Aromatic Chicken Stew</h3>
    <p>
      oro Wet (or Doro Wat) is a celebrated Ethiopian stew made with chicken and
      hard-boiled eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its characteristic deep red color and bold flavor come from two essential
      Ethiopian staples: large quantities of slow-cooked onions that form the
      rich, thick base, and Berbereâ€”a potent, complex spice blend. The chicken
      is cooked until incredibly tender and is traditionally served with Injera
      (a sour, spongy flatbread) to scoop up the luxurious sauce
