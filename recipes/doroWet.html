    <h3>Ethiopia's National Dish: Rich, Spicy, and Aromatic Chicken Stew</h3>
    <p>
      Doro Wet (or Doro Wat) is a celebrated Ethiopian stew made with chicken
      and hard-boiled eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its characteristic deep red color and bold flavor come from two essential
      Ethiopian staples: large quantities of slow-cooked onions that form the
      rich, thick base, and Berbereâ€”a potent, complex spice blend. The chicken
      is cooked until incredibly tender and is traditionally served with Injera
      (a sour, spongy flatbread) to scoop up the luxurious sauce
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken pieces</li>
      <li>hard-boiled eggs</li>
      <li>Red Onions(lots)</li>
      <li>Niter <em>kibbeh</em></li>
      <li>Oil</li>
      <li>Berbere</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep: Wash/marinate the chicken in a lemon/water solution; hard-boil and
        peel the eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook Onions (The Long Step): Dry cook the finely chopped onions in a pot
        over low heat for 15-30 minutes, stirring until they fully break down
        into a thick, wet mash. This forms the stew's base.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build Flavor: Add the Niter Kibbeh (or oil), then stir in the garlic,
        ginger, and generous amounts of Berbere spice mix. Cook for a few
        minutes until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Simmer: Add water/stock, bring to a boil, then add the chicken. Reduce
        the heat and simmer gently for 40-60 minutes until the chicken is tender
        and the sauce is rich and thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finish: Stir in the hard-boiled eggs and simmer for a final 10 minutes
        to allow them to absorb the spice. Serve hot with Injera.
      </li>
